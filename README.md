# Pre-trained BERT Model for Khmer

**\*\*\*\*\* BERT-Khmer \*\*\*\*\***

To make the **[BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert)** compatible with Khmer language, we have modified the official BERT code that presents in **[BERT-Khmer](https://github.com/rifatul-rifat/Pretrained-BERT-model-for-Khmer-language)**.

**\*\*\*\*\* Pre-training \*\*\*\*\***

We have proposed a pre-trained BERT model for Khmer language that has been trained with a large corpus contains more than 100,000 Khmer news articles.
